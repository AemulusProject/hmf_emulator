# Halo mass function emulator
Emulator for the halo mass function from The Aemulus Project. Using this emulator is fairly straightforward. To use the emulator, first install [george](http://dfm.io/george/current/) via pip and [Class](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) (not via pip), as well the [Aemulator](https://github.com/AemulusProject/Aemulator/tree/master/Aemulator) tool (available via pip).

Once you have done so, you can clone this repository and install using `python setup.py install`. This repository is confirmed to work using Python 2.7 and 3.7.
